## 💡 Best Practices for Contributors

* **Follow consistent coding standards**: Use proper formatting, comments, and naming conventions.
* **Keep commits atomic**: Each commit should have a single clear purpose.
* **Write helpful commit messages**: Use verbs like `add`, `fix`, `refactor`, `remove`, `update`.
* **Add comments**: Explain complex or non-obvious logic in your code.
* **Avoid large monolithic PRs**: Break your work into smaller, reviewable chunks.

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

If your changes involve scripts, utilities, or models:

* Test with edge cases and varying input formats.
* Make sure existing functionality is unaffected.
* Add unit tests if applicable.
* Log your results clearly if you're improving model performance.
